# React Todo List

Welcome to the React Todo List repository! This project is a simple web application built with React that allows users to manage their to-do tasks.

## Features

- Task Creation: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list by entering task descriptions.
- Task Management: Users can mark tasks as complete or delete them from the list.
- Task Filtering: Users can filter tasks based on their completion status (e.g., all tasks, completed tasks, or active tasks).
- Task Persistence: The application uses local storage to save and load the user's to-do list, allowing them to access their tasks even after closing the browser.
